Let me out, what you see is not the same person as me
My life's a lie, I'm not who you're looking at
Let me out, set me free, I'm really old
This isn't me
My real body's slowing dying in a vat
Is anybody listening, can anyone understand
Stop looking at me like that and actually help me
Help me, help me I'm gonna die
